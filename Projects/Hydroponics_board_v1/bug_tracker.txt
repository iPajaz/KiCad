fix water level silkscreen: vdd/gnd swapped -> DONE
fix polarity of M1/M3: outputs are flipped wrt M0/M2, so ctrl signals in1/in2 have to be swapped -> DONE

add pu resistor 5k1 or 4k7 to temperature sensor signal
add 1kohm resistor between VDD and water level signal

ph Meter requires clean 5v supply. add that to ph connector

ralay board supply should be 12v. Check if it can be on the normal connector.
